Compiling
---------

If you wish to compile my mods, here's how. Each repo contains the src directory of their respective mod.
Grab the build.gradle and settings.gradle from here.
AwesomeSauceCore -> src
OpenAutomation -> OpenAutomation/src
TreeSpirit -> TreeSpirit/src
RnDTech -> RnDTech/src

Then run `gradlew setupDevWorkspace build`
